# MDIA1620 Class 2 Activity

## Level 1

1. **Clone the activity repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/HenryBcit/mdia1620-class3-activity.git"
  ```
2. **Run the prepare file:**
  ```bash
  node prepare.js
  ```
3. **Find `init.js`:**
  - Use `cd` and `ls` repeatedly until you reach the deepest folder.
  - Use `ls` to confirm `init.js` is present.
4. **Run the chat:**
  ```bash
  node init.js
  ```
5. **Observe the init file carefully**
  - write down at the bottom of the file in comments what's happening in the file in steps.

## Level 2

- **Modify `init.js` to tells a story instead of a chat.**
- **Follow the existing `console.log` structure.**
- **In the story there should be a hero named after a user input.**
- **The story should end after a `number` of lines.**
- **Create a new repository and push your finished work.**

## Level 3 (Challenge)

- **Aside from heroes, there are also enemies, and friends named after a user input**
- How can you add more ways to capture everything?
